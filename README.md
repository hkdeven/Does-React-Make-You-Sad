* If you are confused by the React ecosystem and don’t know where to start, read <a href="https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto" target="_blank">Pete Hunt’s react-howto guide</a>.

* If you are using a Flux library (or Redux) and it adds a lot of boilerplate for no obvious gain, remove it and learn state management in vanilla React with the official <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html" target="_blank">Thinking in React</a> guide.

* If you don’t feel comfortable using ES2015 features (e.g. classes and fat arrows) and you feel like updating your JavaScript knowledge, <a href="https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read" target="_blank">Understanding ECMAScript 6</a> is an amazing guide. Use <a href="https://babeljs.io/repl/" target="_blank">Babel</a> to verify your assumptions.

* If you are just learning React, and a JavaScript bundler like Webpack confuses you, copy <a href="https://github.com/jarsbe/react-simple" target="_blank">jarsbe/react-simple</a> and start hacking with no build step.

* After you’ve learned React itself you can begin learning good deployment practices such as using JavaScript bundlers. Use [Google Page Speed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/) to assess how well your app delivers the client code.
